# **Python-Antivirus-v3.0**
A simple antivirus coded in python capable of scanning selected files and deleting files that it detects as infected. This antivirus uses a large list of MD5 malware hashes my long term goal is to create a fully functioning antivirus.

Thank You! :)

## How to Install:
Install requirements `python -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt`

## NOTE:
When you click "Delete File" the file is GONE so you cant restore it!
